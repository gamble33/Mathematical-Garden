Consequence: The a degree of accuracy of the unsigned binary number was lost by writing it in the normalised floating point representation.

Justification: The bits after the binary point can't be fully accurately represented in the floating-point form.
```

## b
```ad-answer
Binary numbers are stored in normalised form such that bits are utiilised efficiently. No bits are lots as there will never be any leading $0$s in an unsigned floating point value which would impede the accuracy of the representation of the number.

Normalised form also allows the floating point to be converted into decimal as it assumes a position for the binary point (between the leading $0$ and leading $1$ and vice versa for signed floating point values).

Serial file organisation is the process of appending a file (at the end) each time a new record needs to be stored. On the other side of the hand, sequential file organisation will sort the records in the order of a key or other unique identifier. 

Serial file organisation is typically used for files which are temporary which don't require fast access speeds. Sequential file organisation will be used more likely when persistent data needs to be stored such that it can be accessed quickly at later times.

Sequential file organisation allows for direct access wheras, serial files require every record to be checked until the correct one is found.

Packet switching will send a packet of data (or frame) across a network to another node on the network.

The packet header will contain information regarding its intended destination.

At each node, the path of the packet will be re-evaluated and sent to the following node.

This is repeated until the packet reaches its destination.

Multiple packets are sent over the same circuits/lines, therefore, colliions may occur which are solved using DSMCA something like that.
```

## (b)
```ad-answer
The router is responsible for:
- requesting an ip address for an internet provider for the given domain name.
- sending the packet to another node on the network with the calculated path for the packet until its destination.
- receiving the response from the receiver of the packet (Which the router sent) and using NAT to return this information to the original sender of the packet (the device which sent the packet to the router).

SSL and TLS ensure:
- integrity
- non-repundiniatyism
- authenticity
of data transferred when communicating.

They do this by handshaking with another device (with which communication is to be established). Communication is established

## (b)
- Server handshakes with the client.
- hashed digests are sent to each other to ensure communication messages are authentic.
- client checks security certificate of server.
- communication begins
	- communication is encrypted.

Hidden layers allow for more complex patterns to be 'recognised' by a neural network. Having no hidden layers can only allow the model to find linear relationships by which data is classified.
```

## (ii)
Neural networks:
- have weights and biases.
- when training data is fed, the neural network adjusts the weights and biases to give the best possible output when that data is inputted.
	- It minimises the cost function (the difference between the expected output and actual output of the neural network which is dependent on its weights and biases) by using calculus and what not.
- incremental changes to weights and biases.
- This allows for data to be classified.
- When new data is fed to the network, it can give outputs which a human would expect (machine learning).

1. A procedure or function will call itself.
	1. I.e., a procedure or function will contain a reference to its own identifier within its definition.
2. The call stack will keep stack frames (the state of the global and function environment) when a function is called recursively such that rollback can occur.
3. The call stack is unwarped, rolled-back idk how you want to say it. The call stack is unwinded, that is, the top of the call stack is popped and evaluated and the values are passed down to the function that called the top of the stack.

## (b)
```ad-answer
A stack maintains the order in which the functions/procedures were called and allows the most recent function which was called to be evaluated with the required values (by checking the stack frame) and pass down the return value of the function to the next function (which would again need to be popped off the top of the stack).

		RETURN (
			"Error: Stack overflow, 
			the item was not pushed onto the stack."
		)
	ENDIF

	^TopOfStack <- NewInteger
	TopOfStack <- TopOfStack + 1
ENDFUNCTION
