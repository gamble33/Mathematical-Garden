**Lossy**
jpeg is a file format which stores compressed images by reducing their color depth and downsampling, decreasing the image dimensions and then upscaling the image to its original dimensions.

**Lossless**
Run-length encoding (RLE) compresses the bitmap image by grouping patterns of repeated pixel color values. A section such as (A2, 4F, 34, FF, FF, FF, FF, FF, 99, 52) would be grouped into (A2, 4F, 34, FLAG 5 FF, 99, 52)

**Sampling** is the process of taking a stream of analogue values (typically sound) and converting it into a digital approximation and representation. For example a sound wave could be recorded by a microphone. The microphone would take a sample of the amplitude of the sound at every fixed interval (sample rate). This is converted into a digital audio file.

**sampling resolution** is the amount of bits used to represent the amplitude of a wave for each sample. Greater sampling resolution means amplitudes are recorded with more precision, thus, the digital sound file is more accurate to life.

**sampling rate** is the fixed time interval between when each sample is taken. A greater sampling rate means more samples which increases the file size but also increases the accuracy of the representation of sound as sound is analogue and continuous.

There are **data** buses that transfer  data between components in a computer system.

The width of the **dynamic random access memory array** determines the number of directly accessible memory locations.

The **control unit** sends signals on the **central processing unit** to direct the operation of system components.

**clock/tick** pulses are used to synchronise the components on the motherboard.

## b
```ad-answer
Fetch:
The fetch stage retrieves the instruction which needs to be decoded and executed.
- MAR (Memory address register) is given the value of the address (memory location) of the current instruction (which needs to be fetched)
- Control unit (CU) is incremented
- Memory Data Register (MDR) stores the value (opcode, operand) of the current instruction
- The instruction is passed from the MDR to the current instruction (CIR)R register
Decode:
The decode stage is performed by the control unit. It reads the operand and uses some sort of table to decode the instruction and be able to send the appropriate electrical signal.
Execute:
The appropriate electrical signal is sent by the control unit (depending on the opcode) and the instruction is executed.

Interrupts are checked for at the end of every fetch-decode-execute cycle.

This process repeats.

Utility Program: Process manager
Description: A program which can be used to monitor the memory allocated and other info about processes. This program will also allow the user to send a 'KILL' signal to terminate processes.

1. Abstraction / Decoupling: the programmer will not need to know the implementation details of certain functionality required in building operating systems (such as maths libraries).
2. Libraries are tested and often more reliable than code that a programmer can pull together quickly for their project.
3. Saves time, the programmer will not need to spend time re-implementing code which has already been written in a library.

1. Statements are read line-by-line, therefore, errors can be reported for each line (error reporting is improved) whereas compilers only report all errors after reading the entire source code
2. Debugging is easier with interpreter as code can be 'stepped' through.
3. A REPL environment can be used where code can be evaluated instantly during runtime of the interpreter rather than the need for an executable file to be created.
```

## b
```ad-answer
The source code can only be executed if the person executing the program has the interpreter software installed, whereas compilers which produce executable files do not require any additional software to be isntalled in order to execute the program.

The internet protocol address on the internet is usually an IPv4 address

Example IP address: 192.168.0.1

An IP address consists of 4 values of 8 bits (32 bits in total). Each value has a maximum denary value of 255, thus the maximum IP address is: 255.255.255.255

An IP address will sometimes have classes where the first 8-24 bits will represent a HostID and the rest of the bits represent a Client ID. This is paticularly useful for organisations.

Some IP addresses are reserved for specific cases and cannot be used by a node on the network such as 127.0.0.1 which is the loopback ip address used for programmer testing purposes.
