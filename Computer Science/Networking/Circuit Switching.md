For data transfer to occur, the following must happen:
1. Sender provides the identity of intended receiver.
2. System checks whether or not the receiver is ready to accept data.
3. If receiver is available, a sequence of links is established across the network.
4. Data is transferred.
5. Links are removed.

The links provided between nodes in circuit-switched networks are dedicated channels. This means shared transmission media is guaranteed to be unimpeded during transmission.

Circuit switching was traditionally used in the telephone system. However, [[Public Switched Telephone Networks]] (PSTNs) have now largely switched to digital technology.
