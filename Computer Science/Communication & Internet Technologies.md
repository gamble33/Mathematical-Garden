# Circuit & Packet Switching
## Circuit Switching
A dedicated channel/circuit is used which 

| Pros                                                                          | Cons                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Circuit used is **dedicated** to the single transmissions only                | Not flexible (e.g., it will send empty frames and it has to use a single, dedicated line) |
| Whole **bandwidth** is available                                              | **Nobody else** can use the circuit even when its idle                                    |
| Data **transfer rate** is quicker than packet switching                       | Circuit is **always there** whether or not it is used                                         |
| Packets of data (frames) arrive at destination in the **order** the were sent | **No alternative routing** available in case of failure                                   |
