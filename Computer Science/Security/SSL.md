- Although SSL is referred to as a [[Network Protocol|protocol]], it is in fact a [[Network Protocol#Protocol Stack|protocol suite]].
- There is a Record Protocol that deals with the format for data transmission.
- There is also a Handshake Protocol responsible for security.
- The operation of SLL happens without any action from the user.
- The starting point for SSL implementation is a connection between the client and the server being established by [[TCP]].
- The client browser then invokes the Handshake Protocol from the [[SSP]] suite.
- The Handshake Protocol requests from the server its SSL certificate which is a digital certificate confirming its identity.
- The server sends this SSL certificate plus its public key.
- The browser uses this public key to encrypt a key which is to be used as a one-off sesion key for symmetric key encryption to be used for the data transferred during the session.
- There may also be a need at this time to agree which ecnryption algorithms are to be used.
