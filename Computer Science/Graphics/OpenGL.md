A cross-language, **cross-platform** application programming interface specification for rendering 2D and 3D vector **graphics**. The **API** is typically used to interact with a [[GPU|graphics processing unit (GPU)]], to achieve hardware-accelerated rendering.

The manufacturers of graphics cards such as Nvidia implement the OpenGL specification themselves. Thus, the **implementations** of OpenGL tend to be **closed-sourced**.
