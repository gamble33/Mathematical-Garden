# Serial File
---
A file that contains [[Record Data Type|records]] which do not have any defined order. 

An example use case for serial files could be a bank that records customer transactions. Every time a transaction occurs, a record is appended to the end of the serial file. Consequentially, the only ordering of the records is the time of data entry.
