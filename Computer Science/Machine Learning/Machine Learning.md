Machine learning is a subfield of computer science and is the area of study of the creation of algorithms which, to be useful, rely on a collection of examples of some phenomenon.

In other words, machine learning is to collect a dataset and algorithmically create and apply a statistical model based on that dataset.

## Types of machine learning
- [[Supervised Learning]]
- [[Semi-Supervised Learning]]
- [[Unsupervised Learning]]
- [[Reinforcement Learning]]
