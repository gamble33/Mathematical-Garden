# Luminosity
The rate at which energy of all types is radiated by an object in all direcions.

# Stefan-Boltzmann Law (Stefan's Law)
$$L=\sigma A T^4$$
$$=4\pi r^2 \sigma T^4$$

where:
* $L$ is the power output in all directions ($W$)
* $A$ is the surface are of the black body of the star
* $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant
* $T$ is the thermodynamic temperature ($K$)

## Stefan-Boltzmann Constant
Represented by $\sigma$, the Stefan-Botlzmann constant is: 

$$5.67\times10^{-8}\ \frac{W}{m^2K^4}$$

# Wein's Displacement Law (Wein's Law)
$$\lambda_{\text{max}}=\frac{b}{T}$$
where:
- $\lambda_{\text{max}}$ is the wavelength peak (maximum)
- $b$ is the constant of proportionality
- $T$ is the absolute temperature

# Hertzsprung-Russel Diagram
Consider a graph plotted of luminosity against star temperature. A general correlation can be observed. However, with more data, complexity of the picture increases. 

```ad-warning
The temperature measurements assume the star behaves as a black body.

# Black Body Radiatior
A theoretical body which completely absorbs all radiation that lands on it.

As radiation enters the body, it bounces around with a $0\%$ chance of escaping the body on reach reflection (collision with the edges of the body).

# How do Black Holes Form
Stars are collections of hydrogen atoms.

In the core of stars, nuclear fusion occurs to form helium atoms from hydrogen atoms. This process causes the release of energy. 

This radiational energy pushes against gravity (i'm not sure what this means)

As long as nuclear fusion occurs, the star remains stable. For stars with greater mass, heavier elements are formed due to nuclear fusion. Once iron is formed at the core,
