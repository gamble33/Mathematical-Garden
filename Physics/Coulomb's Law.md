# Coulomb's Law
Any 2 point charges exert an electrical force on each other that is proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them
$$F \propto Q_1Q_2$$
$$F \propto \frac{1}{r^2}$$
Thus,
$$F\propto \frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}$$
$$\implies F=\frac{kQ_1Q_2}{r^2}$$
$k$ is a constant of proportionality
$$k=\frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0}$$
where $\varepsilon_0$ is a constant  that is the [[Free Space|permivity of free space]].
$$F=\frac{Q_1Q_2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r^2}$$
