## [[Energy]] Stored
$$\text{energy stored in the capacitor}=\frac{1}{2}QV$$
Only half the of the energy provided by the circuit is store in the capacitor, the rest is dissipated as heat.
$$V=\frac{Q}{C}$$
$$Q=CV$$
$$E=\frac{1}{2}\frac{Q^2}{C}$$
$$E=\frac{1}{2}CV^2$$
## Uses
- Smoothing out [[Voltage|voltages]] in sensitive circuits.
- Short term back-up supply voltages (e.g., to give enough time for a PC to save its state when power is cut).
- Timing circuits (the charge/discharge rate of the capacitor can be used to time short delays in circuits, e.g., interrupts in processing chips)
- Pulsing circuits (circuits that repeatedly turn on and off).
- Tuning circuits (The charge/discharge rate of a capacitor has a natural oscillation that varying [[Resistance|resistance]] in the circuit effects. By fine tuning this resistance, you can calibrate an RC circuit to oscillate to a certain input frequency and tune a radio).
- Filter circuits (To filter out unwanted frequencies and tune a radio).
