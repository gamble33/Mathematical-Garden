The [[Electric Field Strength|electric field strength]] can be determined by
$$E=\frac{V}{d}$$
where:
- $V$ is the [[Voltage|voltage]]  being supplied to the plates (volts).
- $d$ is the distance between the plates (meters).

$$E=\frac{F}{Q}$$
$$E=\frac{V}{d}$$
$$F=QE=\frac{QV}{d}$$
$$F=\frac{eV}{d}$$
