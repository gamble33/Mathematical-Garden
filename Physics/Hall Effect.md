# Hall Effect
---
The movement of [[Charge|charge]] carriers through a [[Conductor|conductor]] towards a [[Magnetic Attraction|magnetic attraction]].

## Hall Voltage
The charge detected as a small voltage across the hall probe.

$$V_H=\frac{BI}{nte}$$
$$V_H=\frac{BL}{ntQ}$$
Where:
- $V_H$ is the hall voltage ($V$ Volts).
- $B$ is [[Magnetic Flux Density|magnetic flux density]] ($T$ Tesla).
- $I$ is [[Current|current]] ($A$ Amps).
- $n$ is [[Electron|electron]] [[Density|density]].
- $t$ is thickness of the conductor ($m$ Meters).
