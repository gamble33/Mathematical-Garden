# Angular [[Velocity]]
---
Angular velocity, usually denoted by $\omega$ is given by [[Angular Displacement|angular displacement]] divided by time.
$$\omega=\frac{\theta}{t}$$
or, in words
$$\text{angular velocity}=\frac{\text{angular displacement}}{\text{time}}$$
## Relating [[Time Period]] and Angular Velocity
 $$\omega=\frac{\theta}{t}$$
A displacement of $2\pi$ radians constitutes one complete cycle.
 
Time period is the time taken for one complete cycle, therefore angular velocity of any object is equal to $2\pi$ divided by its time period.
$$\omega=\frac{2\pi}{T}$$
or
$$T=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}$$
## Relating [[Frequency]] to Angular Velocity
By applying the formula previously derived to the fact that, by definition, $$T=\frac{1}{f}$$
We obtain this formula
$$\frac{1}{f}=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}$$
$$f=\frac{\omega}{2\pi}$$
## Relating [[Linear Velocity]]
#Todo change linear velocity to Velocity#Linear Velocity.
$v=\frac{s}{t}$ and $s=r\theta$, therefore
$$v=\frac{r\theta}{t}$$
$\omega=\frac{\theta}{t}$, therefore:
$$v=r\omega$$
## Example Questions
**A cyclist travels at a speed of $12\space ms^-1$ on a bike with wheels which have a radius of 40cm**
Calculate the frequency of rotation of the wheels.
$$v=r\omega$$
$$\omega=\frac{v}{r}$$
$$\omega=\frac{12}{0.4}=30 \space ms^-1$$
$$f=\frac{30}{2\pi}=\frac{15}{\pi}\approx4.77$$
Calculate angular velocity of the wheels
Answered previously, $\omega=30\space ms^-1$.

Calculate the angle the wheel turns through in $0.1 \space s$ in radians
$$\omega=\frac{\theta}{t}\implies t\omega=\theta$$
$$\theta=0.1\times30=3 \space \text{rad}$$
$$=\frac{3}{2\pi}\times360\approx171.9^{\circ}$$
