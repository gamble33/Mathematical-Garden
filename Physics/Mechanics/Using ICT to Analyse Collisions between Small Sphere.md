# Using ICT to Analyze [[Collision|Collisions]] between Small Sphere
---
## Objective
By recording a collision between two spheres, an analysis of the collision can be performed. In which, the [[Velocity|velocities]] can be determined as time and [[Displacement|displacement]] are determined by observing the frame rate, frames and mapping pixel to actual distances.

## Method
1. Setup apparatus as described
	1. Place two rulers perpendicular to each other to create orthogonal axes. Use a set square.
	2. Position a video recording device directly above the rulers
2. Start recording a video.
3. Roll one sphere towards the other stationary sphere.
4. Stop recording when both spheres come to rest
5. Import the video into a video analysis software such as tracker
6. Calibrate the distances by using of the ruler axes.
7. Step through each frame, calculate the distance travelled in each frame and the time between each frame.
8. Calculate initial  and final $x$ and $y$ velocities of the spheres using Pythagoras' Theorem , $V=\sqrt{(V_x)^2+(V_y)^2)}$.
9. Find the **angle of travel** by using trigonometry.
10. Use the initial and final velocities to calculate initial and final [[Momentum|momentum]] in both orthogonal directions.
