This is quite popular question type.

## Friction
$$F_r=\frac{mv^2}{r}$$
On a level road, when a car travels around a roundabout, the centripetal force required to keep the car moving in a circle is provided by the friction between the road surface and tires.

Friction is directly proportional to weight by the coefficient of friction
$$F=\mu mg$$
#Todo find derivation of this

$$\mu mg = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$
$$\sqrt{\mu g r}=v$$
At the point that at which you skid is when the force of friction is too low. #Elaborate

$$(N_1+N_2)\sin{\theta}=\frac{mv^2}{r}$$
Forces are balanced, so
$$(N_1+N_2)\cos{\theta}=mg$$
now rearrange,
$$\sin{\theta}=\frac{mv^2}{(N_1+N_2)r}$$
$$\cos{\theta}=\frac{mg}{N_1+N_2}$$
$$\frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta}=\frac{mv^2}{(N_1+N_2)r}\times\frac{N_1+N_2}{mg}$$
$$\vdots$$
$$\theta=\arctan{\frac{v^2}{gr}}$$
