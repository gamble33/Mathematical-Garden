$-F$ (Force is exerted by the wall in the direction in which the ball is travelling after the collision)
$$-F\Delta t=m(v-u)$$
$$=m(v-(-v))$$
$$-F\Delta t=-2mv$$
$$\implies \text{impulse} = 2mv$$

Particles are either hadrons or leptons. Leptons are a superset of particles which contain the electron and muon. Hadrons are a superset which contains two sets, baryons and mesons. Protons and neutrons are both baryons. I'm not sure where the neutron is. I know it is made up of the quarks (up, down, down $+\frac23 - \frac13 - \frac13$). So it's a baryon?

```ad-answer
$$F=kx$$
$$E=\frac12 kx^2$$
$$E=\frac12 \times 14 \times 1.7 \times 10^{-2}$$
$$=0.119\ J$$
$$\approx 0.1\ J$$
```

## b
$$\frac12mu^2=0.0136\times 9.81 \times 1.5$$
$$u=\sqrt{\frac{\frac12 \times 0.0136\times 9.81 \times 1.5}{0.0136}}$$
$$\implies u = 5.42 \ ms^{-1}$$

$$\frac12 mu_h^2=0.119$$
$$\implies u_h=6.098\ ms^{-1}$$

$$5.42\times6.4\times10^{-3}\neq7.2\times10^{-3}\times6.098$$

It is significantly more fun to ride on banked surfaces so the go kart track will make more money. Centripetal forces allow car to drive without friction perpendicular to its motion, thus, causing less damage to the road over time.

## a
Air particles would collide with the alpha particle and deflection angles will be randomly and unhelpfully influenced by this.

## b
- Very few alpha particles were deflected at all, they passed right through the golden foil. This implies that most of atom was empty space (mass and positive charge is not distributed evenly)
- A very small percentage of alpha particles were deflected by $180^\circ$ or near it, implying most of positive charge of an atom is concentrated in the nucleus.
- Some alpha particles were deflected by moderate angles
