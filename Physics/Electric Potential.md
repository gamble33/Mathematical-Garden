# Electric Potential
Electric point at a given point is equal to the [[Work Done|work done]] per unit charge ($Q_1$) in bringing that unit positive charge from infinity to that point.

## Absolute Electric Potential
The potential energy per unit of charge for a positive point charge at its given position in an electric field.

If we have two charges where $Q_1$ is an infinite distance away from $Q_2$, then when $r=\infty \implies V=0$.

Symbol: $V$.


It is assumed that electric field lines exiting a positive electric charge continue on for an infinite distance.

With negative charges, it is assumed that their electric field lines are entering the negative electric charge from an infinite distance.

## Equipotential Field Lines

Any given point on every equipotential field line has the same electric potential.

$$\text{electric field}=-\text{potential}$$

$$V=\frac{W}{Q_1}$$
$$\implies W=VQ_1$$
$$W=E_p=\frac{Q_1Q_2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0r}$$
