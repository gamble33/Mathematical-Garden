# Rutherford's Experiment
	
![[Pasted image 20230308173348.png]]

Rutherford designed an experiment to see what what happened when **alpha particles** were directed at a piece of **gold foil**.

His *observations* were:
* The direction in which the number of $\alpha$-particles detected is a maximum: is forwards (i.e., straight through the gold (metal) foil).
* some of the alpha particles were deflected.
	* a very small percentage of the alpha particles were deflected at an angle close to $180^\circ$.

What was *concluded*:
* an atom is mostly void of matter (made up of vacuum/space).
* the nucleus is positively charged (which causes alpha particles to deflect).
* the mass of the atom is concentrated in one part of the atom (nucleus).

The **force** which causes the **deflection** is the **electrostatic force**.


# Looking at Stuff
We can not use light to look at a nucleus as it is too small.

According to de Broglie, all matter has a wavelength defined by:
$$\lambda=\frac{h}{mv}$$

The wavelength of visible light is too great to be useful for observing the structure of an atom. Therefore, high velocity electrons are used which have a lower wavelength. The electron's diffraction is observed. Thus, the space in the atom must be of a similar size to the wavelength of the high-energy electron.

```ad-example
a) Calculate the momentum of electrons with a de Broglie wavelength of $0.11\ nm$

$$0.11\ nm = 1.1 \times 10^{-10}\ m$$
$$\lambda=\frac h {mv}$$
$$\implies mv=\frac{6.63\times10^{-34}}{1.1\times10^{-10}}=6.03\times10^{-24}\  kgms^{-1}$$

b) Calculate the velocity of electrons with this momentum or wavelength.

$$v=\frac{mv}v=\frac{6.03\times10^{-24}}{9.11\times10^{-31}}=6.62\times10^6\ ms^{-1}$$

c) Calculate the potential difference through which the electrons would have to be accelerated to give them this momentum or wavelength

$$E_k=\frac12mv^2=qV$$
$$\implies V= \frac{\frac12mv^2}{q}$$
$$=\frac{\frac12\times9.11\times10^{-31}\times(6.62\times10^6)^2}{1.6\times10^{-19}}=124.6158635\approx125\ V$$

d) 'A stream of neutrons could be used instead of the electrons.' How would the speed of neutrons with a wavelength of $0.11\ nm$ compare with that of the electrons.

$$\text{mass of neutron} = 1.674 \times 10^{-27}\ kg$$
$$v=\frac{h}{m\lambda}=\frac{6.63\times10^{-34}}{1.674 \times 10^{-27} \times 1.1 \times 10^{-10}}=3000.521342 \approx 3000 ms^{-1}$$

This velocity significantly slower by a factor of $1839$.
```

```ad-example
The electron in a hydrogen atom can be described by a stationary wave which is confined within the atom. This means that the de Broglie wavelength associated with it must be similar to the size of the atom, which is of the order of $10^{-10}\ m$

a) Calculate the speed of an electron whose de Broglie wavelength is $10^{-10}\ m$.

$$v=\frac{h}{m\lambda}=\frac{6.63\times10^{-34}}{9.11\times10^{-31}\times10^{-10}}=7.28\times10^6\ ms^{-1}$$

b) Calculate the kinetic energy of this electron in electronvolts.

$$E_k=\frac12 mv^2=\frac12\times9.11\times10^{-31}\times(7.277717\times10^6)^2$$
$$=2.41\times10^{-17}\ J$$
$$\frac{2.41\times10^{-17}}{1.6\times10^{-19}}=151\ eV$$

c) When $\beta$ radiation was first discovered, it was suggested that were electrons in the atomic nucleus, but it was soon realised that this impossible beacuse the energy of such an electron would be too great. Explain why an electron confined within a nucleus would have a much greater energy than the energy calcualted in the previous part.

As an electron approaches the speed of light, by general relativity, the electron's velocity stops increasing, however, its mass will increase instead which causes an increase in kinetic energy.

# Estimation of the Size of a Nucleus
Something with a small wavelength is required, thus, we
* Fire an electron of a high velocity at the nucleus.
	* The electron has a de Broglie wavelength.
* The electron will diffract (because it acts like a wave).
* The diffraction pattern is observed
* From the results, a value for the size of the nucleus is calculated.

```ad-example
Calculate the speed at which an electron must travel if it is to be used to prove the structure of the nucleus. (It would need a de Broglie wavelength of about hte size of the nucleus: $\lambda=5\times10^{-15}$). Comment on your answer.

$$\lambda=\frac{h}{mv}\implies v=\frac{h}{m\lambda}=\frac{6.63\times10^{-34}}{9.11\times10^{-31}\times5\times10^{-15}}=1.46\times10^{11}\ ms^{-1}$$
```

```ad-example
Electrons are accelerated form rest to a kinetic energy of $2.50\ keV$

a) Calculate the potential difference that the electonrs were accelerated through.

$$V=\frac EQ$$
$$E=2.5\times1000\times1.6\times10^{-19}$$
$$\frac{2500\times1.6\times10^{-19}}{1.6\times10^{-19}}=2500$$

b) Calculate the energy of these electrons in joules.

$$E=2.5\times1000\times1.6\times10^{-19}=4\times10^{-16}$$
```

```ad-example
Calculate the speed of electorns which have a kinetic energy of 3000 eV.

First, calculate convert electorn volts to joules.
$$E_k=3000\times1.6\times10^{-19}=4.8\times10^{-16}$$
$$E_k=\frac12mv^2\implies v=\sqrt{\frac{2E_k}{m}}$$
$$\sqrt{\frac{2\times4.8\times10^{-16}}{9.11\times10^{-31}}}=3.25\times10^7$$
```

```ad-example
The de Broglie wave equation can be written as $\lambda=\sqrt{\frac{h^2}{2mE_k}}$.

where:
* $m$ is the mass of the particle
* $h$ is Plancke's constant
* $E_k$ is the kinetic ernergy of the particle
* $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the particle

a) Derive this equation.

$$E_k=\frac12 mv^2\implies v^2=\frac{2E_k}m$$
$$\lambda=\frac h{mv}\implies \lambda^2=\frac{h^2}{m^2v^2}$$
by taking a square the square root of boths sides and substituting for $v$,
$$\lambda=\sqrt{\frac{h^2(m)}{m(2E_k)}}=\sqrt{\frac{h^2}{2mE_k}}$$

b)  An electron is accelerated through $2500\ V$. Using the equation previously derived, calculate the de Broglie wavelength of this electron.

$$\lambda=\sqrt{\frac{h^2}{2mE_k}}=\sqrt{\frac{\left(6.63\times10^{-34}\right)^2}{2\times9.11\times10^{-31}\times2500\times1.6\times10^{-19}}}$$
$$=2.46\times10^{-11}\ m$$
