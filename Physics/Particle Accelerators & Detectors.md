# Linear Accelerator

* An electron enters at $A$.
* The supply is AC to ensure that the electron is always accelerated towards a positive terminal.
* The tubes must increase in length as the AC frequency (and, therefore, time period) is constant, however the particle travels at an increasing velocity, thus, it needs to travel a greater distance before the current is reversed such that the particles is not repelled by a wrongly-charged terminal.
* (Practical Difficulty) The tubes must increase to a great length that is not humanly achievable to continue accelerating the particle (at a certain velocity).

# Derivation of $r=\frac{p}{Bq}$
$$F=Bqv$$
as we are in the context of a particle being accelerated in circular motion, the force provided by the magnetic field is the centripetal force (which can be expressed as $\frac{mv^2}{r}$)
$$\implies Bqv=\frac{mv^2}{r}$$
by dividing both sides by $v$ and rearranging,
$$Bq=\frac{mv}{r}$$
$$r=\frac{p}{Bq}$$
