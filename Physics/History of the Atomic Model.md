# History of the Atomic Model
---
## Ancient Greek Model
The Greeks thought that everything in the universe was made up of indivisible chunks that they called 'Atomos'.

## John-Dalton Model
All atoms are tiny, solid balls (similar to very small pool balls). The balls or atoms of each element were different sizes. He uses the size difference to explain the difference between elements and their reactivity. He would say that some elements are too small or too big to react with others.

## J.J. Thompson Model
Often referred to as the 'plumb pudding model'. He thought that an atom was solid and consisted of an area of positive charge and throughout the atom, areas of negative charge. He came up with this idea after discovering the electron. He knew electrons had to be negative because they could be attracted towards a positive plate. 

He also knew that atoms are, overall, neutrally charged as when they are placed between  positively and negatively charged plates, they don't deviate. Therefore, he knew that if there were negatively charged areas, then there had to be a sufficient amount of positively charged areas to neutralize the negative charge.
