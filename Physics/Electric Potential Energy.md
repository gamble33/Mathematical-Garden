For a uniform field, charges gain [[Energy]] as they move through the field, more often then not they are accelerated towards a potential and therefore gain [[Kinetic Energy]]

$$E_P=QV$$
$$E_P=\frac12 mv^2$$
$$E_p=\frac{q_1q_2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0r}$$

where:
* $m$ is the [[Mass]] of an [[Charge]] ($kg$)
* $v$ is the [[Velocity]] of an [[Charge]] ($ms^{-1}$)
* $V$ is [[Voltage]] ($V$)
* $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the [[Charge|charges]] ($C$)
* $r$ is the distance between the charges ($m$)
* $\varepsilon_0$ is [[Free Space]] ($Fm^{-1}$)

Calculate the [[Energy]] required to separate the ions in sodium chloride by $9.4 \times 10^{-10} \ m$.

* Sodium ion has a relative charge of $-1$ or $-1.6\times 10^{-19}$
* Chlorine has a relative charge of $+1$ or $1.6\times 10^{-19}$

$$E_p = \frac {-1.6\times10^{-19}\times1.6\times10^{-19}}{4\pi \times \varepsilon_0\times9.4 \times 10^{-10}}=-2.45 \times 10^{-19}\ J$$
