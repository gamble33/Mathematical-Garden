# Faraday's Law
The induced EMF is equal to the rate of change of flux linkage.
$$\varepsilon=-N\frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t}$$
where:
* $\varepsilon$ is induced voltage
* $N$ is number of loops in the coil
* $\Delta \Phi$ is change in magnetic flux
* $\Delta t$ change in time

> [!Recap]
> Magnetic flux, $\Phi$ is how much magnetism is in an area
> 
> Measured in Webers ($Wb)$
> 
> $$\Phi = BA$$

# Lenz's Law
The EMF induced is such to oppose the change of relative displacement causing it.

> [!Note]
> This is why there is a negative sign in [[Electromagnetic Induction#Faraday's Law|Faraday's Law]].

> [!Summary] 
> If the magnet is moving away from the solenoid, the solenoid will attract it.
> 
> If the magnetic is moving towards the solenoid, the solenoid will repel it.

> [!Example]
> An aeroplane with a wingspan of $20\ m$ flies horizontally at a speed of $300\ ms^{-1}$. If the Earth's vertical component of magnetic flux desnsity is $5.2 \times 10^{-5}\ T$, calculate the emf induced between its wingtips
> 
> $N=1$ because the aeroplane can be considered to be a wire with a single loop.
> $$\varepsilon = -N\frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t}=-\frac{BA}{\Delta t}=-\frac{Blv\Delta t}{\Delta t}=-Bvl$$
> $$\varepsilon=5.2\times10^{-5}\times300\times20$$

# Magnetic Forces
The force on a charged particle moving at right angles to magnetic field is given by
$$F=Bqv$$
The centripetal force is given by 
$$F=\frac{mv^2}{r}$$
$$\implies Bqv = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$
