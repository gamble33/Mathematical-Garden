# Discharging Capacitor Time Constant
---
By [[Ohm's Law]]:
$$V=\frac{I}{R}\implies I=\frac{V}{R}$$
By the formula of [[Capacitance|capacitance]]:
$$V=\frac{Q}{C}$$
With every small increase of $\delta t$ seconds, $Q$ will become $Q - \delta Q$. [[Charge]] is decreasing, therefore:
$$\delta Q = -I\delta t$$
Divide by $Q$
$$\frac{\delta Q}{Q}=-\frac{I\delta t}{CRI}=-\frac{\delta t}{RC}$$
or
$$\frac{dQ}{Q}=-\frac{dt}{RC}$$
