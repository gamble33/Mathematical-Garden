#Inaccurate
The work function, often denoted as $\phi$ or $W$, is the minimum amount of [[Thermodynamic Work|thermodynamic work]] required to [[Ionisation|ionise]] a piece of metal. I.e., the minimum energy required for an electron at the highest quantised state to be "moved from a point in vacuum, immediately outside the solid surface"[^1]
