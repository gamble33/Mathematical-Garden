## Uniform Electric Field
$$E=\frac{V}{d}$$
Where: 
- $E$ is the [[Electric Field Strength|electric field strength]] ($NC^{-1}$ Newtons per Coulomb).
- $V$ is [[Potential Difference|potential difference]] ($V$ Volts).
- $d$ is distance between two [[Charged Plates|plates]] or [[Electrodes|electrodes]] ($m$ meters).

Objects are usually electrically neutral but they can be charged by:
- [[Charging by Rubbing]]
- [[Charging by Induction]]
- [[Charging by Conduction]]
