Simple harmonic motion is the motion of an object such that the restoring force is proportional to displacement.

```ad-summary
Acceleration:
$$a=-(2\pi f)^2x$$

Displacement:
$$x=A\cos (2\pi ft)$$
Speed:
$$v=\omega \sqrt{A^2-x^2}$$

Maximum Speed:
$$v_{\text{max}}=\omega A$$

Maximum Acceleration:
$$a_{\text{max}}=\omega^2A$$

For a mass-spring system:
$$T=2\pi \sqrt{\frac m k}$$

For a simple pendulum:
$$T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac l g}$$

where:
- $A$ is the amplitude
- $\omega$ is angular velocity ($\text{rad}\ s^{-1}$)
- $f$ is the frequency ($Hz$)
- $x$ is the displacement ($m$)
- $v$ is the velocity ($ms^{-1}$)
- $a$ is the acceleration ($ms^{-2}$)
```

Simply put, simple harmonic motion is anything that moves back and forth.

**Time Period for a mass on a spring**
$$T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac m k}$$
where:
* $m$ is the mass ($kg$)
* $k$ is the spring constant

**Derivation**
$$F=kx=ma$$
$$a=\omega^2x$$
$$\implies kx=m\omega^2x$$
$$\implies k=m\omega^2$$
$$\implies k=m4\pi^2 f^2$$
$$\frac{1}{4\pi^2}\frac{k}{m}=f^2$$
$$f=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$$

**Time Period for a pendulum**
$$T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac l g}$$
where:
* $l$ is the length ($m$)
* $g$ is acceleration due to gravity ($9.81\ ms^{-2}$)

Acceleration always acts towards the centre.
$$a=-\omega^2 x$$
$$\implies a \propto -x$$
$$ $$
$$x=A\cos\omega t$$
$$\implies v = -\omega A\sin\omega t$$
$$ $$
$$T=\frac 1 f = \frac {2\pi} \omega$$
$$\omega = 2\pi f$$

## Damping
An external force acting to reduce the amplitude of oscillations
![[Pasted image 20230424191056.png]]

For example, a simple pendulum experiences air resistance which damps the oscillation amplitude and eventually brings the system to rest.

```ad-definition
When a mechanical system is displaced from its equilibrium position and allowed to oscillate without any external forces, its motion is referred to as **free oscillation**.
```

```ad-definition
The frequency of an oscillation is known as the **natural frequency**.
```

```ad-definition
A **forced oscillation** is one in which a driver force is applied to an oscilattor. In this case the system will oscillate at the frequency of the driving force, the **driving frequency**.

$$\cos \theta = \frac {2.1} {2.8}$$
$$\cos^{-1}\left(\cos \theta\right) = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac {2.1} {2.8}\right)$$
$$\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac {2.1} {2.8}\right)$$
