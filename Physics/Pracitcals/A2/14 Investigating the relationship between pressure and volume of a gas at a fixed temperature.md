Aim: To investigate the relationship between pressure and volume of a gas at a fixed temperature.

Materials:

-   Gas syringe or a gas-tight piston-cylinder apparatus
-   Gas sample (such as air, helium, or carbon dioxide)
-   Pressure sensor or pressure gauge
-   Ruler or tape measure
-   Thermometer (to measure temperature)
-   Stopwatch

Procedure:

1.  Set up the gas syringe or piston-cylinder apparatus and attach the pressure sensor or gauge to it.
2.  Measure the initial volume of the gas sample using the ruler or tape measure.
3.  Record the initial pressure and temperature of the gas sample.
4.  Apply a small force to the gas syringe or piston-cylinder apparatus to decrease the volume of the gas sample by a small amount.
5.  Record the new pressure and volume of the gas sample.
6.  Repeat steps 4 and 5 several times, decreasing the volume of the gas sample each time by the same amount and recording the pressure and volume each time.
7.  Plot a graph of pressure (y-axis) against volume (x-axis) using the recorded data.
8.  Analyse the graph to determine the relationship between pressure and volume at a fixed temperature.

Results: The data collected from the experiment can be plotted on a graph with pressure on the y-axis and volume on the x-axis. The resulting graph should show an inverse relationship between pressure and volume, indicating that as the volume of the gas sample decreases, the pressure increases, and vice versa. The graph should also show a linear relationship between pressure and volume, indicating that the relationship between pressure and volume is proportional.

Conclusion: From the results of the experiment, it can be concluded that at a fixed temperature, the pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume. This relationship is described by the equation PV=k, where P is pressure, V is volume, and k is a constant value that depends on the temperature and the number of gas particles present. The experiment can also be used to determine the value of k, which is equal to the product of the pressure and volume at any given point in the experiment. The experiment can be repeated at different temperatures to investigate the effect of temperature on the relationship between pressure and volume of a gas.
