# Investigating the tension, mass per unit length and length of vibrating string
---
* What length of string might be used?
	2 meters.
* What mass of the weight might be used?
	0.5 kilograms.
* Why are the movable bridges used?
	To allow the variable length $L$ (the length under which the string is vibrating) to be changed.
* What material could be used for the string?
	* Nylon
	* Steel
* How would we decide on a frequency
	Chose the fundamental frequency because it will have the greatest amplitude and so is the easiest to observe.

## Example Method
1. Setup apparatus as shown in diagram.
2. Adjust length $L$ until it is $1.000$ meters by using the meter rule.
3. Increase/decrease frequency $f$ until the string oscillates at the first harmonic (fundamental frequency)
4. Read and record $f$.
5. Reduce $L$ by $0.100$ meters
6. Repeat steps 3-5 two more times and record the mean frequency $f$ for each length $L$.
7. Measure the mass of the string on the balance and record it.

## Description
What measurements would be made?
* Length of vibration section $L$.
	* Resolution would be equal to that of the measuring device (ruler)
* Mass of string $M$.
	* Resolution would be equal to that of the measuring device (scale)
* Fundamental frequency $f$.
	* Resolution would be equal to the smallest interval of the vibration generator or to the deviation between the mean and the extreme values.

Would repeat readings be useful
* Yes, especially when trying to determine the fundamental frequency. Repeat readings reduce undcertainty.
* $v=\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}=f \lambda$, $f=2L$  for the fundamental frequency. $\implies \lambda = \frac{1}{2L} \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$
	* $\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$ is constant so that is the gradient.
	* The variable expression is $\frac{1}{2L}$ 
	* A graph of frequency $f$ against $\frac{1}{2L}$ can be plotted so that $\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}=v$ can be found.
	* The experimental value (gradient of the graph) of $\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$ can be compared with the measured value.
		* The measured value is determined by finding the tension, mass, and length and calculating it.
* Main sources of uncertainty are
	* Determining the frequency at which the first harmonic occurs.
	* Measuring the length $L$ with the ruler (errors such as parallax may occur).
