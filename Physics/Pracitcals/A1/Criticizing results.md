# Criticizing Results

* Not all values are given to the same degree of [[Accuracy|accuracy]]; i.e., the values have inconsistent number of **significant figures**.
* **Range of values** is small. 
	* This is situational. Here only frequencies between 256-512 Hz are used, while the human hearing range goes up to 20 kHz.
* There are only four sets of results.
	* This will make it more difficult to identify anomalies.
* The **intervals** between values of the independent variable are **uneven**.
	* This makes it more difficult to identify the trend of the graph when the results are plotted.
