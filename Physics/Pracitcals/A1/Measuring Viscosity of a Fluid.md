When the ball is falling at terminal velocity
$$\text{Weight}=\text{Upthrust} + \text{Vicous Drag Force}$$
$$W=U+F$$
$$F=W-U$$
$$F = \eta 6 \pi r v \implies \eta = \frac{F}{6\pi r v}$$
$$W=\rho_B\times V \times g=\frac{m}{V} \times V\times g=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \times \rho_B \times g$$
Where:
	$\rho_B$ is the density of the metal that composes the ball
	$V$ is the volume of the ball
$$U=\rho_L\times V \times g$$
$$\implies \eta = \frac{\frac{4}{3}\rho_B\pi r^3g - \frac{4}{3}\rho_L\pi r^3g}{6 \pi r v}$$
$$=\frac{\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3g(\rho_B-\rho_L)}{6\pi r v}$$
$$=\frac{\frac{2}{9}r^2g(\rho_B-\rho_L)}{v}$$
$$=\frac{2r^2g(\rho_B-\rho_L)}{9v}$$
## Method: Falling-Ball Alternative
Mark the position of the ball in the tube at fixed time intervals.

The distances between the points should be equal when the ball reaches terminal velocity.
Plot graph of Velocity $v$ against time $t$. Terminal velocity can be determined by extrapolation or inspection. 
The uncertainty can be decreased by repeating this process multiple (e.g., 5) times and plotting the average velocity.

## Method: Falling-Ball Alternative 2
- Weight each ball, measure its radius $r$ and calculate its density $\rho$.
- Place 3 rubber bands around tube.
	- Position highest band a level below the surface of the viscous fluid. The ball must be travelling at terminal velocity when it reaches this band.
	- Placed remaining bands apart from each other such that the time intervals are reasonable and can be recorded. This will enable you to measure the terminal velocity twice for each falling ball.
- Release first ball into viscous [[Fluid|fluid]]. 
- Start the timer when the ball passes the highest rubber bands.
- Repeat the ball dropping and measuring process 3 times for each ball.
- Use the lap-timer facility to record the time taken $\Delta t_1$ and $\Delta t_2$.
- Measure the displacements between the rubber bands $\Delta s_1$ and $\Delta s_2$.

Errors
* Measure displacements of rubber bands at eye-level to avoid [[Parallax Error|parallax error]]
