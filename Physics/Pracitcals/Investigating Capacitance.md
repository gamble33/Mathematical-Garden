# Investigating [[Capacitance]]
To investigate the relationship between capacitance, [[Potential Difference|potential difference]] and [[Charge|charge]], we can setup a circuit as shown

When the switch is closed, the [[Capacitor|capacitor]] will charge. The variable resistor needs to be continually adjusted to keep the [[Current|current]] constant which can be seen on the [[Ammeter|microammeter]].

By using a high resistance [[Voltmeter|voltmeter]], the potential difference across the capacitor can be measured.

To investigate how potential difference across the capacitor changes with time for a constant current.
- Use a stopwatch to measure the voltmeter reading at regular intervals (alternatively you could use a data logger).
- Calculate the charge at each time interval using $Q=It$.
- Plot a graph of charge against potential difference.
- The gradient of the graph is the capacitance of the capacitor ($C=\frac{Q}{V}=\text{gradient}$).
