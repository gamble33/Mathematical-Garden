# Determining the Resistivity of a Metal Wire
---
#Todo Circuit Diagram & real picture with cell, voltmeter, ammeter, extendable metal wire (adjustable by crocodile clip) and ruler.

## Method
1. Setup apparatus as shown.
2. Determine the cross-sectional area of the metal wire with the use of a micrometer. Measure the diameter at perpendicular angles and take the arithmetic mean of the measurements. Then use formula $A=\pi (\frac{d}{2})^2$ to determine the area.
3. Measure the length of the copper wire with a ruler. Determine resistance in the metal wire with formula derived from Ohm's Law $R=\frac{V}{I}$. Obtain voltage and current by reading the voltmeter and ammeter respectively.
4. Record the results of previous step, repeated at multiple different lengths.
5. Plot a graph of length against resistance $R=\frac{\rho}{A}L$.
6. Measure the gradient and multiply it by the wire's cross-sectional area to determine the resistivity of the metal wire.

## Measurement & Uncertainties
- Measure the diameter at perpendicular angles and take the arithmetic mean.
- Take reading from ruler at eye-level to avoid parallax.
- Ensure that the contact of the crocodile-clips is viable.
- Ensure that the *zero* of the ruler is at the start of the wire to prevent *zero-error*.
- Ensure that a sufficient number of repeats were carried out.
- Ensure the wire is straight in order to measure true $L$.
- Use voltmeter and ammeter with more significant figures to reduce uncertainty.
		- Ensure the current is small to keep the temperature low, as temperature affects resistance and would introduce more variables.jjX

## Issue
With only a wire and power pack, the wire receives the same full voltage irrespective of length. So $V=I\times R$ is a constant. When the length is very small, the resistance is very small. This means current is very large => So the wire melts.

With a variable resistor in the circuit, the supply voltage is now shared between the wire and the resistor. The load is shared. So, less current is flowing. We can adjust the resistance of the variable resistor. This changes the share of voltage across it. Wire now doesn't melt.

## Different Experiment Variants

- Total voltage across wire is constant.
- Current through wire is constant, so wire doesn't melt.
- Voltage across wire is divided into two parts dependent on the lengths of the ends of wire.
- I.e., $\frac{L_1}{L_2}=\frac{V_1}{V_2}$.
- $V=IR$ so ratios of voltages matches ratios of resistances of lengths of wire.
