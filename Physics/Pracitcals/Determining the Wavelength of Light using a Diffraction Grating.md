## Method
1. Setup apparatus as shown in the diagram.
2. Determine $s$ by reading the lines per mm, $\mu$, on the grating and dividing 1 millimetre by the $\mu$. I.e., $s = \frac{1}{\mu} \times 10^{-3}$. It is multiplied by $10^{-3}$ to convert millimetres into meters.
3. Measure the distance, $L$, from the screen to the diffraction grating with a ruler.
4. Measure the distance, $x$, between the brightest, central dot (the $0^{\text{th}}$ order fringe) and an adjacent ($1^{\text{st}}$ order fringe) dot. 5. Calculate wavelength, $\lambda$, with formula $\lambda = \frac{x\times s}{\sqrt{x^2+L^2}}$.

## Repeats

* The formula $\lambda=\frac{d\sin{\theta}}{n}$ allows the wavelength to be determined with any order fringe
	* Distance between two adjacent fringes should be measured, and that order $n$ should be used in the formula to determine the wavelength.
