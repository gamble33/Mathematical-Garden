# Nuclear Stability
When a graph is plotted of the neutron number against the proton number of an atom, it looks as follows:

```ad-important
Radioactive decay is spontaneous and random. There are no governing factors for the rate of decay except the number of radioactive atoms.
```

## Activity
Activity is the rate of popping
$$\text{activity}=A=\frac{\Delta N}{\Delta t}$$
$$A=A_0e^{-\lambda t}$$
Unit: Becquerels ($Bq$)

**Activity Constant, $\lambda$**

the activity constant, $\lambda$ is the probability of the dacy of an individual nucleus per unit time.
$A=\lambda N$

where: 
- $\lambda$ is the decay constant ($s^{-1}$)

The number of radioactive atoms, $N$, is proportional to the activity. Thus, *mass* and *count-rate* are also proportional to $A$.

```ad-example
The decay constant for Carbon 14 is $\lambda=3.84\times10^{-12}\ s^{-1}$. What is the activity of asample of $100 \times10^9$ atoms of Carbon 14?

$$3.84\times10^{-12}\times100\times10^9$$
$$=0.384\ Bq$$
```

## Count Rate
The number of decays recorded each second.

```ad-info
The count rate would be the number of 'clicks' heard by a Giger-Miller tube per second.
```

Count rate is proportional to [[Radioactivity#Activity|activity]]

Units: Count per minute or Count per second

# Background Radiation
```ad-example
Cosmic Background Radiation
Radon Gas in air
Bananas
```

# Half Life
$$T_{\frac12}=\frac{\ln 2}{\lambda}$$
$$N=N_0e^{-\lambda t}$$

# Mass Defect / Mass Deficit
Mass of the constituents of a nucleus is always more than the mass of the nucleus.
![[Pasted image 20230307181152.png]]
here the deuterium nucleus has less mass than its spearated nucleons

```ad-definition
The difference in the constituents to nucleus is called the **mass defect**.
```

```ad-example
Calcualte the mass defect of a helium necleus in $amu$ and in $kg$.

$$\text{mass of proton}=1.00728\ amu$$
$$\text{mass of neutron}=1.00867\ amu$$
$$\text{quoted mass of helium nucleus}=4.00151\ amu$$
$$1\ amu=1.6605\times10^{-27}\ kg$$

$$ $$

$$\implies\Delta m=2(1.00728 + 1.00867) - 4.00151$$
$$=0.03039\ amu$$
$$=0.03039\times1.6605\times10^{-27}=5.046\times10^{-29}\ kg$$
```

# Mass and Energy Equivalence
$$E=mc^2$$
When a system has a change of energy, there will be an associated change of mass too.

```ad-example
When a tennis ball with a mass $200\ g$ is acted upon byu a resultant force and accelerates, it gains kinetic energy. The increase in kinetic energy means that there will be an equivalent increase in mass. There is a difference in the resting mass and moving mass, this can be easily calculated.

The tennis ball accelerated and reached a speed of $55.6\ ms^{-1}$. This means it now has a kinetic energy of:

$$E_k=\frac12mv^2=\frac12\times0.2\times55.6^2=309.136\ J$$

by, $E=mc^2\rightarrow m=\frac{E}{c^2}$, the mass gained is:

$$\Delta m = \frac{309.136}{\left(3\times10^8\right)^2}=3.435\times10^{-15}\ kg$$

For reference, a proton's mass is in order of $10^{-27}$.

```

```ad-important
Work must be done to overcome the strong force when separating the constituents of an atom.

This means there is an energy change, and thus, a mass change when separating, say, a helium nucleus.

Thus, $2$ separated protons will have a greater mass than the nucleus of a helium atom (which contains $2$ protons). Crazy right? üòÆ
```

# Binding Energy
```ad-definition
**Binding energy** is the minimum energy required to separate a nucleus into its constituent parts.
```

```ad-definition
**Binding energy per nuclueon** is calculated by dividing the the binding energy by the mass number.

It is used to compare the difficulty of separation of different atoms.
```

```ad-example
After calculating the mass defect of a helium atom:

$$\Delta m=0.03039\ amu$$
$$=0.03039\times1.6605\times10^{-27}=5.046\times10^{-29}\ kg$$

The binding eneryg can be calculated
$$E=mc^2\implies E=5.046\times10^{-29}\times\left(3\times10^8\right)^2$$
$$\text{binding energy}=4.54\times10^{-12}\ J$$
```

# How to determine whether a nuclear reaction occurs naturally

**Golden Rule**

The $LHS$ mass must be greater than the mass of the $RHS$.

This is because if mass increases, energy must have been provided to the system fro the reaction to occur, thus, it could not have happened naturally.

Conversely, if mass decreases, then energy must decrease, therefore, energy is given out (no additional energy was required for the reaction to occur).

```ad-example
Cobalt-60 is an artificially produced radioisotope that can be used to treat cancer. It emits beta particles of energy $0.3\ MeV$ and gamma rays of energy $1.3\ MeV$
$$^{60}_{27}\text{Co} \rightarrow ^{60}_{28}\text{Ni} + ^{0}_{-1}\beta^-$$

b) State, with a reason, the penetrating powers of each of the two types of radiation emitted by the cobalt-60
- gamma radiation penetrates through surfacs easily, however, it is not significantly ionising.
- When beta radiation is emitted, surfaces are not penetrated easily, however, beta radiaton are more ionising.

c) State one risk to a patient associated with the use of radioisotopes to treat cancer.

Radiation (such as alpha particles) can be ionising and cause damage to tissue.
```

```ad-example
Technetium-99m is an unstable isotope which decays by emitting $\gamma$ radiation. The decay process is random. The half life of this isotope is $2.16
\times10^4\ s$ 

(a) (i) State what is meant by 'random'
- It is unknown exactly when $\gamma$ radiation will be emitted.

(ii) State what is meant by 'half life'
- $T_{\frac12}=\frac{\ln 2}{\lambda}$
- Half life is the amount of time it takes for an unstable nucleus to decay and lose $50\%$ of its mass

(b) A sample containing $7.30
\times10^{19}$ atoms of technetium-99m is prepared for use in a medical application.

(i) Show that the activity of the sample when it was prepared is about $2.3\times10^{15}\ Bq$
$$N=7.30\times10^{19}$$
$$T_{\frac12}=2.16\times10^4\ s$$
$$T_{\frac12}=\frac{\ln 2}{\lambda}, A=\lambda N$$
$$\implies A=\frac{\ln 2}{T_{\frac12}}N=\frac{\ln 2}{2.16\times10^4}\times7.30\times10^{19}=$$
$$=2.3426\times10^{15}\approx2.3\times10^{15}$$

(ii) Calculate the activity of the sample $1$ day after the sample was prepared.

$$1\text{ day}=86400\ s$$
$$A=A_0e^{-\lambda t}$$
$$A=2.3426\times10^{15}e^{-\frac{\ln2}{2.16\times10^4}\times86400}$$
$$=1.46\times10^{14}\ Bq$$
````

```ad-example
(i) Explain why $GeV/c$ is a valid unit for momentum.

$GeV$ is a unit of energy.
$$E=mc^2\implies \frac{E}{c}=mc$$
$mc$ has units $kgms^{-1}$ which are the base units for momentum.
```

# Nuclear Fission
```ad-definition
**Nuclear fisison** is the splitting of large/heavy nucleus into smaller/lighter nuclei.
```

$$^{235}_92 U + ^{1}_{0}n \rightarrow ^{90}_{36}Kr + ^{143}_{56}Ba + 3^{1}_{0}n$$
The $RHS$ has a lower mass. This is due to Einstien's equation which states that equivalence of mass and energy.

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- |
| Least deaths per unit produced | Non-renewable |
| Less $\text{CO}_2$ emission (Carbon Dioxide is only emitted during construction) than fossil fuels | Expensive to build and decomission |
| High energy density | always produces hazardous waste (half life of Barium and Krypton is thousands of years, what do you do with this stuff)? |


## Chain Reaction
![[Pasted image 20230313185903.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230313190917.png]]

## Difficulties
- Wrong Isotope.
- It could become nuclear and kill everybody.
- A fast-moving neutron may rebound from the unstable nucleus rather than being absorbed into the unstable nucleus.
	- The neutron must be slowed down into thermal neutrons.
		- Fast-moving neutrons are slowed down to thermal levels via a **moderator**.
- A lot of energy is created which needs to be harnessed.
	- This is done via coolant

![[–°–Ω–∏–º–æ–∫ —ç–∫—Ä–∞–Ω–∞ 2023-03-14 –≤ 19.27.34.png]]

Neutrons must be slowed down. This is the job of the **moderator**.

Neutrons have to be absorbed to avoid a chain reaction. This is the job of the **control rods**.

The heat generated by the fission must be transferred to the heat exchanger. This is the job of the **colant**.

# Nuclear Fusion
 Nuclear fission is the process of a large nucleus breaking into two smaller (lighter) nuclei. Conversely, nuclear fusion involves two light nuclei which are joined together by force. 

Mass of the new, heavier, nucleus is less than the mass of its constituents. This is because some of the mass is converted into energy.

Not all of this energy is used as binding energy. Some energy is released from the reaction. The binding energy per nucleon is greater post collision than prior to it. 

## Energy Source
This energy released can be harnessed. Converting hydrogen into helium with the release of energy could provide the planet's energy requirements. 

Hydrogen is ubiquitous (such as in seas and bodies of water). Helium which is the bi-product of this energy production method is an inert gas which can be released into the upper atmosphere. This makes nuclear fusion a renewable and environmentally friendly energy production method.

*Scientists have not yet succesfully maintained a nuclear fusion reaction* (#Todo double check if this is up to date). The kinetic energy required for two positively charged protons to fuse (overcome the great electrostatic repulsion) is in the order of millions of kelvin (i.e., **high temperatures required**). A very **high density is required** as well. $235\ g$ of hydrogen undergoing nuclear fusion would produce $1.40\times10^{14}\ J$.
