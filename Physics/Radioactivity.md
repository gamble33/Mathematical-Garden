# Nuclear Stability
When a graph is plotted of the neutron number against the proton number of an atom, it looks as follows:

```ad-important
Radioactive decay is spontaneous and random. There are no governing factors for the rate of decay except the number of radioactive atoms.
```

## Activity
Activity is the rate of popping
$$\text{activity}=A=\frac{\Delta N}{\Delta t}$$
$$A=A_0e^{-\lambda t}$$
Unit: Becquerels ($Bq$)

**Activity Constant, $\lambda$**

the activity constant, $\lambda$ is the probability of the dacy of an individual nucleus per unit time.
$A=\lambda N$

where: 
- $\lambda$ is the decay constant ($s^{-1}$)

The number of radioactive atoms, $N$, is proportional to the activity. Thus, *mass* and *count-rate* are also proportional to $A$.

```ad-example
The decay constant for Carbon 14 is $\lambda=3.84\times10^{-12}\ s^{-1}$. What is the activity of asample of $100 \times10^9$ atoms of Carbon 14?

$$3.84\times10^{-12}\times100\times10^9$$
$$=0.384\ Bq$$
```

## Count Rate
The number of decays recorded each second.

```ad-info
The count rate would be the number of 'clicks' heard by a Giger-Miller tube per second.
```

Count rate is proportional to [[Radioactivity#Activity|activity]]

Units: Count per minute or Count per second

# Background Radiation
```ad-example
Cosmic Background Radiation
Radon Gas in air
Bananas
```

# Half Life
$$T_{\frac12}=\frac{\ln 2}{\lambda}$$
$$N=N_0e^{-\lambda t}$$

# Mass Defect / Mass Deficit
Mass of the constituents of a nucleus is always more than the mass of the nucleus.
![[Pasted image 20230307181152.png]]
here the deuterium nucleus has less mass than its spearated nucleons

```ad-definition
The difference in the constituents to nucleus is called the **mass defect**.
```

```ad-example
Calcualte the mass defect of a helium necleus in $amu$ and in $kg$.

$$\text{mass of proton}=1.00728\ amu$$
$$\text{mass of neutron}=1.00867\ amu$$
$$\text{quoted mass of helium nucleus}=4.00151\ amu$$
$$1\ amu=1.6605\times10^{-27}\ kg$$

$$ $$

$$\implies\Delta m=2(1.00728 + 1.00867) - 4.00151$$
$$=0.03039\ amu$$
$$=0.03039\times1.6605\times10^{-27}=5.046\times10^{-29}\ kg$$
```

# Mass and Energy Equivalence
$$E=mc^2$$
When a system has a change of energy, there will be an associated change of mass too.

```ad-example
When a tennis ball with a mass $200\ g$ is acted upon byu a resultant force and accelerates, it gains kinetic energy. The increase in kinetic energy means that there will be an equivalent increase in mass. There is a difference in the resting mass and moving mass, this can be easily calculated.

The tennis ball accelerated and reached a speed of $55.6\ ms^{-1}$. This means it now has a kinetic energy of:

$$E_k=\frac12mv^2=\frac12\times0.2\times55.6^2=309.136\ J$$

by, $E=mc^2\rightarrow m=\frac{E}{c^2}$, the mass gained is:

$$\Delta m = \frac{309.136}{\left(3\times10^8\right)^2}=3.435\times10^{-15}\ kg$$

For reference, a proton's mass is in order of $10^{-27}$.

```

```ad-important
Work must be done to overcome the strong force when separating the constituents of an atom.

This means there is an energy change, and thus, a mass change when separating, say, a helium nucleus.

Thus, $2$ separated protons will have a greater mass than the nucleus of a helium atom (which contains $2$ protons). Crazy right? ðŸ˜®
```

# Binding Energy
```ad-definition
**Binding energy** is the minimum energy required to separate a nucleus into its constituent parts.
```

```ad-definition
**Binding energy per nuclueon** is calculated by dividing the the binding energy by the mass number.

It is used to compare the difficulty of separation of different atoms.
```

```ad-example
After calculating the mass defect of a helium atom:

$$\Delta m=0.03039\ amu$$
$$=0.03039\times1.6605\times10^{-27}=5.046\times10^{-29}\ kg$$

The binding eneryg can be calculated
$$E=mc^2\implies E=5.046\times10^{-29}\times\left(3\times10^8\right)^2$$
$$\text{binding energy}=4.54\times10^{-12}\ J$$
```

# How to determine whether a nuclear reaction occurs naturally

**Golden Rule**

The $LHS$ mass must be greater than the mass of the $RHS$.

This is because if mass increases, energy must have been provided to the system fro the reaction to occur, thus, it could not have happened naturally.

Conversely, if mass decreases, then energy must decrease, therefore, energy is given out (no additional energy was required for the reaction to occur).
