# Magnetic Flux Density
The [[Force|force]] on 1 meter of wire carrying a [[Current|current]] of 1 [[Amperage|amp]] at right angles to a [[Magnetic Field|magnetic field]]. ([[Vector|vector]] quantity).

$$B=\frac{F}{IL}$$

Where :
- $F$ is the force exerted on a wire.
- $B$ strength of the magnetic field.
- $I$ is the current flowing through the wire.
- $L$ the length of the wire.

Units: $T$ (Tesla)

## Current Crossing Fields
$$F=BIL\sin\theta$$

> [!Note]
> There is only a force when current cuts across the magnetic field lines. I.e., if the direction of current is parallel to the magnetic field lines then there is no force. The force is greatest when the current cuts across it at $90^{\circ}$.
