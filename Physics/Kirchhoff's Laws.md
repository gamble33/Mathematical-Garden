# Kirchhoff's Laws
## Circuit Law
In a circuit, at any junction, the [[Current|current]] in will be equal to the current out.
$$I\space\text{in}=I\space\text{out}$$

## Voltage Law
The [[Voltage|voltage]] around a loop in a circuit is equal to the sum of every voltage drop in the same loop. I.e., there will be no loss of voltage around a loop.
$$\text{e.m.f.}=\sum{\text{p.d. of every component}}$$
