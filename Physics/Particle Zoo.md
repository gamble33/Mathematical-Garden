> In recent times, many new particles were hypothesised to exist and confirmed via experiments including helpful inventions such as a particle accelerator. The set of particles that were discovered were categorised and defined within (what is now called) 'The Standard Model'. There are 24 of these particles. 12 of which are antiparticles.
> 
> The are generations of particles. With further generations, mass of the particles increase and time since discovery increases.

> All particles, either, make up matter or constitute a force.

# Particle Accelerators
Inside the Large **Hadron** Accelerator (at CERN), two *particle* beams (of high energy) adjacent to each other. The particles travel at speeds close to the speed of light ($99.999999\%$ of the speed of light). The particles travel in opposite directions to each other. They travel through an 'ultrahigh vacuum'. 

An magnetic field is used to manipulate the force exerted on the particles (in order to control their direction). The magnetic field is created by superconducter coils. They conduct electricity efficiently with minimal resistance and loss of energy (which requires a temperature of $-271.3^\circ C$).

The opposing beams of protons collide at certain points in the collider. 

A 'resonator' is used to accelerate protons by letting them travel at the peak of the wave and then reversing. By increasing the speed at which the wave reverses, the protons can be accelerated to greater rates.

By Einstein's theory of relativity, when accelerating mass near the speed of light, instead of increasing the velocity of the body, the body would actually gain mass. A consequence of this  is that the protons gain more mass when accelerated, thus, requiring a greater force to accelerate them further.
