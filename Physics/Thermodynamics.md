- A is the liquid phase
- B is melting point
- C, it is now

```ad-definition
**Specific heat capacity** is the energy required to change the temperature by $1^\circ$ of $1\ kg$ of a substance.
```

# Specific Heat Capacity
$$E=mc\Delta\theta$$
Where:
- $E$ is the energy transfer
- $m$ is the mass of the substance
- $c$ is the specific heat capacity of the substance
- $\Delta \theta$ is the temperature change

# Calculating Energy Changes
```ad-hint
Latent means hidden.
```

The latent eat of fusion is the amount of energy required to change $1\ kg$ of a substance from/to a solid/liquid. It is given the symbol $L_f$.

The latent eat of vaporisation is the amount of energy required to change $1\ kg$ of a substance from/to a liquid/gas. It is given the symbol $L_v$.

```ad-example
(a) $100\ g$ of paraffin was is heated by $15\space^\circ \text{C}$. What is the energy transfer?

Specific heat capacity of paraffin is $2200 \ J kg^{-1} K^{-1}$.

$$E=0.1\times2200\times15=3300$$

(b) A copper block of $500\ g$ is heated from room temperature by $70\ ^\circ \text{C}$. This takes $13.5\ kJ$. What is the calculated specific heat capacity.

$$c=\frac{13.5\times10^3}{0.5\times70}=386\ J(kgK)^{-1}$$
```

```ad-example
(a) $20\ kg$ of oxygen is cooled from a gast to a liquid. $4.3\ MJ$ is released. What is the sepcific latent heat of vaporisation.

$$E=m\times L_v$$
$$\implies L_v=\frac{E}{m}=\frac{4.3 \times 10^6}{20}=2.15\times10^5$$

(b) $1.5\ kg$ of water is heated from a liquid to a gas. How much energy is required? 

$$L_f=2.26\times10^6$$
$$E=mL_f=1.5\times2.26\times10^6=3.39\times10^6$$
```

```ad-example
What is the energy transfer involved when $500\ g$ of water ice at $-5^\circ C$ is heated to $28^\circ C$ on a hot day, melting in the process? Use $c_{\text{ice}}=2.0\times10^3\ Jkg^{-1}K^{-1}$.

Step 1: From $-5$ to $0$,
$$E=mc\Delta\theta=0.5\times2\times10^3\times5=5\times10^3\ J$$

Step 2: From $0$ to $28$,
$$E=mc\Delta\theta=0.5\times4.2\times10^3\times28=5.88\times10^4\ J$$

Step 3: Melting
$$E=mL_f=0.5\times3.3\times10^4=1.65\times10^4\ J$$

Therefore total energy transfer is
$$8.03\times10^4\ J$$
```

# Internal Energy
```ad-definition
**Internel energy** is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of the atoms or molecules of a substance.
```

# Triple Point
```ad-definition
The **triple point** occurs where the solid, liquid and gas transition curves meet. 

The triple point is the only condition in which all three phases can coexist, and is unique for every material. Water reaches it triple point at just above freezing ($0.1^\circ\ C$) and at pressure of $0.006\ \text{atm}$
```

# Absolute Zero
```ad-definition
**Absolute zero** is the lowest possible energy
```

```ad-warning
Absolute zero is not the point of zero energy.

At absolute zero:
$$E_k=0$$
however,
$$\text{internal energy} \neq 0$$

instead, internal energy is at a minimum.
```

# Thermal Physics Support
$$E=mc\Delta\theta$$
$$E=mL_f$$
$$E=mL_v$$
```ad-question
**1**

(a)
$$Pt=mc\Delta\theta$$
$$2100t=1.5c\times80$$
$$c_w=4184$$
$$\implies t=\frac{1.5\times4184\times80}{2100}=239.1\ s$$

(b)
Kinetic energy of the particles is increasing as temperature increases. Once the water stats boiling, there is no net increase of energy as kinetic energy increases, however, potenetial energy decreases (bonds (electro-static forces of attraction) between particles are overcome)
```

```ad-question
**2**
$$E=mc\Delta\theta$$
$$Pt=mc\Delta\theta$$
$$20\times60\times3=0.38\times c\times5$$
$$\implies c=\frac{3600}{0.38\times5}=1895\ Jkg^{-1}K^{-1}$$
```

```ad-question
**3**
$$E=mc_c\Delta\theta$$
$$E=mc_w\Delta\theta$$

$$E=0.8\times400(76-\theta_F)$$
$$E=2\times4200(\theta_F-15)$$

$$0.8\times400(76-\theta_F)=2\times4200(\theta_F-15)$$
$$24320-320\theta_F=8400\theta_F-126000$$
$$\implies \theta_F=17.2\space^\circ\text{C}$$
```

# Ideal Gasses
## Assumptions
The following descriptions are assumed of an ideal gas. These assumptions are made to simplify the gas behvaiour

- Gas contains a large number of atoms.
- Atoms of the gas occupy a negligible volume compared to the volume of the gas.
- All collisions are elastic
- Time of collision is negligible compared to time between collisions
- Electrostatic forces are negligible except during collisions (i.e., $E_p=0$; there are no potential energies)
## Gas Laws
There are three quantities which should be considered.
- Pressure
- Volume
- Temperature

### Boyle's Law
$$P_1V_1=P_2V_2$$

### Charles' Law
$$\frac{V_1}{T_1}=\frac{V_2}{T_2}$$

### Gay-Lussac's Law
$$\frac{P_1}{T_1}=\frac{P_2}{T_2}$$

### Equation of State
$$\frac{P_1V_1}{T_1}=\frac{P_2V_2}{T_2}=R$$

$$PV=nRT$$
where
- $R=8.31\ J\text{mol}^{-1}K^{-1}$ is the molar constant
- $n$ is the number of moles

### Boltzmann Constant
$$K=\frac{R}{N_A}=1.38\times10^{-23} JK^{-1}$$
where:
- $N_A$ is Avogadro's constant



## Converting from Celsius to Kelvin
$$0K=-273\space^\circ\text{C}$$

## Mean Kinetic Energy & Temperature
Temperature and kinetic energy are proportional
$$E_k=\frac12mc^2=\frac32KT$$

## Root Mean Square
The root mean square speed is the speed associated with average kinetic energy.

$$\sqrt{\overline{(c^2)}}$$
![[Pasted image 20230323191126.png]]
This distribution shows that there are no molecules with $0$ energy. A few molecules have high energy. There is no maximum energy a molecule can have.

As a gas gets hotter, the number of particles with greater energies (and, thus, speeds) increases. This is why the curve becomes 'fatter' and 'shorter'.

At low temperatures, energies and speeds of particles are relatively low low.

## Probable velocity
$$\text{probable velocity} \neq \text{mean velocity}$$
Probably velocity is defined as the velocity which most particles will have, that is, the peak of the maxwell-boltzmann distribution.

## Molecular Speeds & Masses
At a given temperature, all gasses have an equal average kinetic energy.

## Mean Molecular Kinetic Energy
$$\frac13Nmc^2=NKT$$
$$\frac13mc^2=KT$$
$$\frac12mc^2\times\frac23=KT$$
$$\frac12mc^2=\frac32KT$$
