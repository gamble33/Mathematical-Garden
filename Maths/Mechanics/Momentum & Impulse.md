# Introduction

$$P=mv$$
where:
- $P$ is momentum ($kgms^{-1}$ or $Ns$)
- $m$ is mass ($kg$)
- $v$ is velocity ($ms^{-1}$)

```ad-note
Note that velocity is a vector as is force, therefore, momentum will also be a vector.
```

If we differentiate $P$ with respect to time, we find force.
$$F=\frac{dP}{dt}$$

$$F\times dt=dP$$
$$\int^{t_1}_{t_0} F\times dt=\int^{t_1}_{t_0} dP$$
$$\left[F(t)\times t\right]^{t_1}_{t_0}=I=\text{impulse}$$
The impulse is the difference between the momentum initially and the final momentum. Impulse is, thus, also measured in $Ns$

```ad-observation
When modelling a collision, we generally consider the change to be instantaneous. In reality, this is never the case.

In order to change the momentum of an object, a force must be applied over a period of time. Therefore, there must be contact between the two objects for that time period.

Consider a ball hitting a bat. It appears as though this interaction is instantenous, however, if you view the interaction in slow-motion, you will see the ball making contact; the bat bending; the ball compressing, and then those same processes in reverse. This will all take a fraction of a second but some time (it is not instantenous).

# Collisions

**Newton's Third Law**
Newton states that for every action in nature, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

So far in our study, we've interpreted action to mean force. However, in the study of momentum, the action can be impulse.

Therefore, if two particles collide ($A$ and $B$) the impulse that $B$ exerts on $A$ will be equal and opposite to the impulse that $A$ exerts on $B$.

The result to this equal and opposite impulse is that on the given system, the total impulses will cancel out. Therefore, we arrive at the law of **conservation of momentum**.

$$\sum P_i = \sum P_f$$

```ad-example
**Missing Mass**

Two particles $A$ and $B$, of mass $0.3\ kg$ and $m\ kg$ respectively, are moving in opposite directions along the same straight horizontal line so that the particles collide directly. Immediately before the collision, the speeds of $A$ and $B$ are $8\ ms^{-1}$ and $4\ ms^{-1}$. respectively. In the collision the direction of motion of each particle is reversed and, immediately after the collsiion, the speed of each particle is $2\ ms^{-1}$.

Find the magnitude of the impulse exerted by $B$ on $A$ in the collsiion.

$$I=-2\times0.3 - 8\times 0.3=-3\ Ns$$

Find the mass of particle $B$.

$$8\times0.3-4m=-2\times0.3+2m$$
$$0.3(8+2)=6m \implies m=0.5\ kg$$
```

```ad-example
**Missing Velocity**

Consider two particles $A$ and $B$ with masses and $2\ kg$ and $1\ kg$ respectively moving in the same direction where $A$ has a velocity of $3\ ms^{-1}$ and $B$ has a velocity of $1\ ms^{-1}$. Following a collsion $A$ now has a velocity of $1\ ms^{-1}$.

Find the velocity of $B$

$B$ exerts an impulse on $A$ of:
$$I=1\times2-3\times2=-4\ Ns$$
Therefore, $A$ must exert an impulse of $4\ Ns$ on $B$.
$$I_B=4=v_2-1$$
$$\implies v_2=5\ ms^{-1}$$
```

Combining Particles
---
When two particles combine, their velocities will be equal. They can be treated as one particle with a mass equal to the sum of the masses of its constituents. 

We see this in examples such as particles connected by string or trains linking together.

```ad-example
Two particles P and Q, of masses 8kg and 2kg respectively, are connected by a light inextensible string. The particles are at rest on a smooth horizontal plane with the string slack. Particle P is projected directly away from Q with speed $4\ ùëöùë†^{‚àí1}$. Find the common speed of the particles after the string goes taut. Find the magnitude of the impulse transmitted through the string when it goes taught.

$$8\times4+2\times0=8v+2v$$
$$32=10v \implies v = 3.2\ ms^{-1}$$

$$I_Q=2(v-0)=2v=6.4\ Ns$$
```

```ad-example
A truck $P$ of mass $2M$ is moving with speed $U$ on smooth straight horizontal rails. It collides directly with another truck $Q$ of mass $3M$ which is moving with speed $4U$ in the opposite direction on the same rails. The trucsk join so that immediately after the collsion they move together. By modelling the trucks as particles,

![[Momentum & Impulse 2023-04-27 12.39.15.excalidraw]]

find the speed of the trucks immediately after the collision.

$$2MU-12MU=5Mv$$
$$-10U=5v$$
$$v=-2U$$
$$|v|=2U$$

Find the magnitude of the impulse exerted on $P$ by $Q$ in the collision.

$$I_P=2M(v-U)=-6MU$$
$$|I_P|=6MU$$
```

# Inelastic Collisions
So far we have considered collisions where there is one unknown value ($v$ or $m$). However, we can also consider systems where both final velocities are unknown. Notice, this introduces a second unknown and therefore will require a simultaneous equation.

One of the equations in the system will be the conservation of momentum.

The second equation will be the loss of relative kinetic energy which is calculated by the material property known as the coefficient of restitution.

The coefficient of restitution, $e$, has no units (similar to friction). It is a value between $0$ and $1$ (similar to friction). It measures the relative velocity before and after a collision.

If $e=1$, we describe the collision as perfectly elastic.

If $e=0$, the collision is totally inelastic. In other words, the particles will coalesce/join together.

$$e=\frac{v_1-v_0}{u_0-u_1}$$

As such, $e$ can be thought of as the percentage of relative velocity conserved.

```ad-example
Two particles A and B of masses 200g and 400g respectively are travelling in opposite directions towards each other on a smooth surface with speeds of 5ùëöùë†^(‚àí1) and 4ùëöùë†^(‚àí1) respectively. They collide directly, and immediately after their collision have velocities ùë£_1 ùëöùë†^(‚àí1) and ùë£_2 ùëöùë†^(‚àí1) respectively, measured in the direction of the motion of A before the collision. Given that the coefficient of restitution between A and B is 1/2, find ùë£_1and ùë£_2

![[Momentum & Impulse 2023-04-27 13.05.40.excalidraw]]

**Newton's Law of Restitution**
$$e=\frac{v-u}{5-(-4)}=\frac{v-u}{9}=\frac12$$
$$\implies v-u=4.5$$

**Conservation of Momentum**
$$1-1.6=0.2u+0.4v$$
$$-6=2u+4v$$

Solving Simultaneously
$$-3=u+2(4.5+u)$$
$$-3=9+3u$$
$$u=-4\ ms^{-1}$$
$$\implies v =0.5\ ms^{-1}$$
```

## Finding Limiting Values of Problems
Problem solving questions can ask us to find limits/maxima of velocities. 

Some questions to ask our selves to help:
- Directions of particles?
- Limits of $e \in [0,1]$?
- Collision Logic (big particle wins)?
- Future collisions?

```ad-example
![[Pasted image 20230501145028.png]]
Using conservation of momentum:
$$-2=-2v_1-3v_2$$
$$2=2v_1+3v_2$$
$$e=\frac{v_1-v_2}{u_0-u_1}=\frac{v_1-v_2}{9}$$
$$=\frac{\frac{2-3v_2}{2}-v_2}{9}$$
$$e=\frac{2-5v_2}{18}$$
$$\implies 0\leq \frac{2-5v_2}{18} \leq 1$$

$$-\frac{16}{5} \leq v_2 \leq \frac52$$
Direction of $v_2$ is unchanged, therefore:
$$0 \lt v_2 \leq \frac52$$
```

```ad-example
![[Pasted image 20230501151933.png]]
$$0 \leq e \leq 1$$
by conservation of momentum,
$$10u-12u=-2ku-3v_2$$
$$-2u=-2ku-3v_2$$
$$2u(1-k)=3v_2$$
by coefficient of restitution:
$$e=\frac{ku-v_2}{9u}$$
$$e=\frac{ku-v_2}{9u}$$
$$e=\frac{3ku-2u(1-k)}{27u}$$
$$e=\frac{5k-2}{27}$$
$$\implies 0 \leq \frac{5k-2}{27} \leq 1$$
$$\frac25 \leq k \leq \frac {29} {5}$$
this is the result of using the coefficient of restitution as a limit. However, if the maximum impulse of the particles is taken into account:
$$I_{\text{max}}=4u\times3-0\times3=12u$$
$$P_{\text{max}}=5u\times2-12u=-2u$$
thus,
$$v_{\text{max}}=-u$$
This implies $k$ has an upper bound of $1$.
$$\frac25 \leq k \leq 1$$
```

![[Pasted image 20230501154131.png]]
The $3\ kg$ particle must be able to catch up to the $2\ kg$ particle in order for a collision to occur.
$$u_2\gt2$$
$v_2$ must be less than $4$. If $v_2$ was greater than $4$, then the collision wasn't completed.
$$v_2\leq4$$
$$0 \leq e \ \leq 1$$
$$e=\frac{4-v_2}{}$$
