# Odd Function
An odd function is such that:
$$f(-x)\equiv-f(x)$$
**Examples**
$$\sinh{(-x)}\equiv-\sinh{(x)}$$
$$\sin{(-x)}\equiv-\sin{(x)}$$
$$\tan{(-x)}\equiv-\tan{(x)}$$
$$f(x)=x^3$$
## Properties
- Odd functions are rotationally symmetric (order 2) about the origin.
# Even Function
An even function is such that:
$$f(-x)\equiv f(x)$$
**Examples**
$$\cosh{(-x)}=\cosh{(x)}$$
$$\cos{(-x)}=\cos{(x)}$$
$$f(x)=x^{2n},\space n\in\mathbb{N}_0 $$
## Properties
- Even functions are not rotationally symmetric about the origin.
- They are symmetric in the line $x=0$.
# Properties of Compositions of Odds and Evens
- The only function whose domain is all real numbers which is both odd and even, is the constant function which is identically zero, 
- The sum of two even functions is even, and the sum of two odd functions is odd.
- The difference of two even functions is even, and the difference of two odd functions is odd.
- The product of two even functions is even, and the product of two odd functions is even.
- The product of an even function and an odd function is an odd function.
- The quotient of two even functions is even, and the quotient of two odd functions is even.
- The quotient of an even function and an odd function is an odd function.
- The derivative of an even function is odd, and the derivative of an odd function is even.
- The composition of two even functions is even, and the composition of two odd functions is odd.
- The composition of an even function and an odd function is even.

# Application to Integration
$$I=\int\limits^{a}_{-a}{f(x)}dx$$
$$\text{if}\space f\space\text{is even}$$
$$\text{then}\space I=2\times\int\limits^{a}_{-a}{f(x)}dx$$
$$\text{if}\space f\space\text{is odd}$$
$$\text{then}\space I=0$$
