## [[Set]] Notation
A set is denoted as a capital, calligraphic character such as $\mathcal{S}$. 

A set of a fixed amount of numbers such as $\{5, 8, 19, 28, 32\}$ is denoted using accolades.

>[!Note]
>Accolades are curly braces `'{}'`

A set of infinite values between two numbers $a$ and $b$ (that doesn't include $a$ or $b$), i.e., an open set is denoted using parentheses $(a,b)$. Whereas, a set that includes all values between and including both $a$ and $b$ is denoted as $[a,b]$.

## Capital Sigma Notation
The sum of all the elements in a [[Notation#Set Notation|set]] $\mathcal{X}=\{x_1,x_2,x_3,...,x_n\}$ is represented as 
$$\sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}{x_i} \stackrel{\mbox{def}}{=}x_1+x_2+x_3+...+x_n$$
