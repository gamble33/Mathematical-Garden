## Defined as
The symbol $\stackrel{\mbox{def}}{=}$ means "is defined as".

## [[Set]] Notation
A set is denoted as a capital, calligraphic character such as $\mathcal{S}$. 

A set of a fixed amount of numbers such as $\{5, 8, 19, 28, 32\}$ is denoted using accolades.

>[!Note]
>Accolades are curly braces `'{}'`

A set of infinite values between two numbers $a$ and $b$ (that doesn't include $a$ or $b$), i.e., an open set is denoted using parentheses $(a,b)$. Whereas, a set that includes all values between and including both $a$ and $b$ is denoted as $[a,b]$.

## Capital Sigma Notation
The sum of all the elements in a [[Notation#Set Notation|set]] $\mathcal{X}=\{x_1,x_2,x_3,...,x_n\}$ is represented as 
$$\sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}{x_i} \stackrel{\mbox{def}}{=}x_1+x_2+x_3+...+x_n$$

# Sums of [[Roots of Polynomials]] Notation
$\sum{\alpha\beta}=\text{Sum of all possible pairs of roots}$
$$\sum{\alpha}=\alpha+\beta+\gamma+\delta+\space...\space=S_1$$
$$\sum{\alpha^2}=\alpha^2+\beta^2+\gamma^2+\delta^2+\space...\space=S_2$$
$$\sum{\alpha^n}=\alpha^n+\beta^n+\gamma^n+\delta^n+\space...\space=S_n$$
## Matrix Notation
Bold capital letter. 
$${\bf{A}}=\left(\begin{matrix}1 & 5 & 4 \\ 2 & 3 & 9\end{matrix}\right)$$
$${\bf{C}}={\bf{P}}^{-1}{\bf{TP}}$$
## Vector Notation
Bold, lowercase letters. Usually Latin for variables. Unknown constants are written in Greek letters.

## Logic Notation
$$\text{Or:}\space +, \lor$$
$$\text{And:}\space ., \land$$
$$\text{Negation:}\space {\overline A}, \neg A$$
