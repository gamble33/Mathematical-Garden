# Problem Solving (In The Wild)
---
Step 1: Understand the problem
- Do you understand all the words used in stating the problem?
- What are you asked to find or show?
- Can you restate the problem in your own words?
- Can you think of a picture or diagram that might help you understand the problem?
- Is there enough information to enable you to find a solution?

Step 2: Devise a Plan
- Guess & Check.
- Look for a pattern.
- Make an orderly list.
- Draw a picture.
- Eliminate possibilities.
- Solve a simpler problem.
- Use symmetry.
- Use a model.
- Consider special cases.
- Work backwards.
- Use direct reasoning.
- Use a formula.
- Solve an equation.
- Be ingenious.

Step 3: Carry out the plan
Have care and patience. Persist with the plan you have chosen. If it continues not to work, discard it and choose another.

> During exams,
> - use rigorous mathematical notation.
> - Please communicate clearly with the utility of the English language and full sentences.

Step 4: Look Back
Much can be gained by taking the time to reflect and look back at what you have done, what worked, and what didn't. Doing this will enable you to predict what strategy to use to solve future problems


## Examples
### Guess & Check.
### Look for a pattern.
### Make an orderly list.
### Draw a picture.
### Eliminate Unlikely Methods.
### Eliminate possibilities.
#### Problem:

#### Method:
![[Pasted image 20221012123257.png]]
Find turning points of cubic equation derived from question and eliminate possible graphs by using the derivative (turning points) and intercepts of the cubic.
### Solve a simpler problem.
#### Problem:
Given $N$ points in 3D space, construct a convex polyhedron from these points.

#### Method:
To solve a simpler problem first, the 2D case with convex polygon can be considered.

### Use symmetry.

The important part to note, is the ingenious use of 'without loss of generality'.

I.e., if it is true for $a$ and $p$ then it is also true for $b$ and $q$.

### Use a model.
### Consider special cases.
### Work backwards.
### Use direct reasoning.
### Use a formula.
### Solve an equation.
### Be ingenious.

## Common Tricks
1. A hidden quadratic.
2. Compound Identity: if a pair is equal, then their sums are equal.
3. Difference of squares.
4. Change the base of logarithms and more importantly of exponentials.
5. Solve equations implicitly. (Remember the proof of the sum of a geometric sequence or the integral of $e^x\sin{x}$)
6. Check for [[Odd and Even Functions]].
## Common Traps
