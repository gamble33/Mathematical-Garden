[^1]:It is defined that $F(x)$ is the [[Cumulative Distribution Function|cumulative distribution function]]


# Probability Density Function
---
If $X$ is a continuous random variable with P.D.F $f(x)$, then:
- $f(x) \geq 0$
- $P(a < X < b) = \int ^b_a{f(x)}dx$
- $\int^\infty_{-\infty}{f(x)}dx=1$

$P(X \leq x) = F(x)$^[1]

## Measures of Location
### Mean
$$F(m)=0.5$$
### Lower Quartile
$$F(Q_1) = 0.25$$
### Upper Quartile
$$F(Q_2) = 0.75$$
### Mode
The value where the P.D.F is the greatest. The global maximum.
