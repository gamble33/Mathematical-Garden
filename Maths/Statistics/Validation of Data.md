## Accuracy
The degree of conformity of a measure to a standard or a true value. In a general case, accuracy is difficult to achieve through [[Data Cleansing|data cleansing]] as it requires accessing an external source of data that contains the true value.

## Completeness
The degree to which all required measures are known. Incompleteness is almost impossible to fix with data cleansing methodology as facts cannot be inferred for data that was not recorded.

## Consistency
The degree to which a set of measures are equivalent (in method of measurement) in different systems.

## Uniformity
The degree to which a set of data measures are specified using the same units of measure in all system.
