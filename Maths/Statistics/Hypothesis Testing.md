## Hypothesis
A Hypothesis is a statement made about the value of a **population parameter** that we wish to test by collecting evidence in the form of a sample.
* The null hypothesis, $H_0$, is the default position, i.e., that nothing has changed, unless proven otherwise.
* The alternative hypothesis, $H_1$, is that there has been some change in the population parameter.

## Test statistic
In a hypothesis test, the evidence from the sample is a test statistic.

## Level of significance
The level of significance, $\alpha$, is the maximum probability where we would reject the null hypothesis. This is usually $5\%$ or $1\%$.
