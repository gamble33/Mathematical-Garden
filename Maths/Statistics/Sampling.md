# Sampling
---
A sample is some subset of the population intended to be representative of the [[Population|population]]

## Sampling Unit
A sampling unit is each individual thing in the population that can be sampled.

## Sampling Frame
A sampling frame is a list of all sampling units from which a sample is taken.

## Census
A census is a sample that is the entire set of the population.

| Census | Should give a completely accurate result   | Time consuming, Expensive, Requires large volume of data, Can not be used when testing involves destruction |
| Sample | Cheaper, Quicker, Less data to process     | Data may not be accurate, Data may not be large enough to represent small sub-groups                          |
