$$\mu = E(X) = \int^{+\infty}_{-\infty}{xf(x)}dx$$
The expected value for a symmetric [[Probability Density Function|P.D.F]], in a finite interval, is the midpoint of that interval.

For piecewise functions, the same formula applies to find the expected value, just apply it to each function and sum the results.
