# Proof that $S^2$ is an unbiased estimator for $\sigma^2$
---
It is known by rearranging the [[Variance#Definition|definition for variance]] that
 $$\sigma^2=E(X^2)-E(X)^2$$
 $$\sigma^2=E(X^2)-\mu^2$$
 $$E(X^2)=\sigma^2+\mu^2$$
We also known [[Proof that sample variance is actual variance divided by sample size]] $$\text{Var}(\overline{X})=\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$$
