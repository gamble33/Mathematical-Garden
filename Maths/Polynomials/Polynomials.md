# Polynomials

A polynomial is an expression consisting of indeterminates and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponentiation of variables.[^1]

An example of a polynomial of a single indeterminate $x$ is $x^2 - 4x + 7$. An example in three variables is $x^3 + 2xyz^2 - yz + 1$[^1]
