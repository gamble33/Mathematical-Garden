Every non-constant single-variable [[Polynomials|polynomial]] with [[Complex Numbers|complex]] coefficients has at least one complex.

Gauss stated
Every polynomial of degree $n$ must have exactly $n$ roots.

Factor Theorem
let $p_n(x) =$ a polynomial of degree $n$.
$$\text{iff}\space p_n(a) = 0$$ then $$(x-a)$$ is a factor of $$p_n(x)$$
